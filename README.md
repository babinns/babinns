- 👋 Hi, I’m @babinns
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development but also learning frontend (sometimes enchanted by thoughts of ds and automation #toomuch)
- 🌱 I’m currently developing a 'Smart Pantry' 'App' with MERN stack which has been a project of mine for some time but I'm focused on finishing it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovating projects and hopefully have an opportunity 
- 📫 How to reach me barbaranl.business@gmail.com

Some projects I've made are private in my profile due to the possibility of containing sensitive info regarding company data.
Ex: excel sheets cleaning and automation with py.
features(pages, functionality with nodejs) added to private web pages.
